allocator
        has a backing store
        tracks - homogenous objects ( to start )
        allocation is via placement new
        allocator must keep track of rd_ptr, wr_ptr semantics
                  - rd_ptr being the start of memory
                  - wr_ptr being the next allocation point
                  - n objects allocated/used




        questions - does it need any notion of a header
                  - do we need to do any kind of allignment
                  - is memory contingous - is this an array
                  - should we have header automatically
